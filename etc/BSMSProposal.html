<h1>
Proposal for Five-Year Bachelor/Master's Degree Program
<hr WIDTH="100%"></h1>
Proposal for a five-year BS in Creative Studies/MS in Computer Science
submitted by the Department of Computer Science and the College of Creative
Studies (CCS).
<h2>
Projected Need</h2>
The program will help meet the increasing need for people with advanced
degrees in computer science, which is deemed a priority of California's
economy.
<p>We expect that graduates of this program will either enter a Ph.D. program
at some other research university, or take a high level information technology&nbsp;
job.&nbsp; They however are not disallowed from applying to the Computer
Science Department's Ph.D. program under the same admission guidelines
as those for other students in the master's program.
<p>This program is being proposed because, for the past couple of years,
several CCS students have requested admission to the Computer Science Department's
BS/MS five year program.&nbsp; We do not expect this demand to diminish
in the foreseeable future.
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
Upper division degree requirements for CCS students with the computer science
emphasis are identical to those of computer science students: It essentially
is a computer science degree with one important difference:&nbsp; CCS students
typically are engaged in graduate level research <i>during</i> their undergraduate
studies, making some of them them ideal candidates for our BS/MS program.&nbsp;
The existing five-year BS/MS program in computer science however is not
open to students in CCS, since their BS is not in computer science.&nbsp;
This proposal is intended to work around this obstacle.
<p>The proposed program's objectives are twofold:
<ul>
<li>
To increase the attractiveness of the BS in Creative Studies with an emphasis
in computer science to top high school students.</li>

<li>
To create a new source of high quality masters students for the Computer
Science Department.</li>
</ul>
The degree requirements for the joint degree program are the same as those
for the individual B.S. and M.S. programs.
<h2>
Program</h2>
The program of study for both degrees for this combined program is the
same as that for the individual degrees.&nbsp; In particular, there are
no restrictions on specialization in computer science for the proposed
program.&nbsp; While we allow students to take either the thesis option
(Plan 1) or the comprehensive examination option (Plan 2), we expect most
students to elect the examination option.&nbsp; Plan 1 would require a
minimum of 30 upper-division and graduate units, including no less than
20 units in graduate courses as outlined below.&nbsp; Plan 2 would require
a minimum of 36 upper division and graduate units, of which no fewer than
24 must be graduate units as outlined below.&nbsp; Both plans' unit requirements
exclude TA or GSR practica, and 597 or 598 independent study units.&nbsp;
No more than 12 units of 596 units would be counted toward fulfilment of
these requirements. The master's component of the program can be completed
in the required three terms of residence for the graduate degree because
12 of its required units can be taken during the student's senior year,
leaving only 34 units to take during the entire fifth year.
<p>Undergraduates would apply for this program according to the same time-lines
as are used for the existing five-year BS/MS program in computer science:&nbsp;
To be eligible for admission to this program, the Creative Studies student
with an emphasis in Computer Science, based on the number of units completed,
is either a Junior at the start of the Spring quarter, or a Senior at the
start of the Fall quarter.&nbsp; During the Spring quarter of the junior
year, students apply to the Computer Science Department for admission to
the BS/MS program. The student must:
<ol>
<li>
Submit the Undergraduate Major Field Electives, MS Study Plan, and the
Proposed Schedule of Departmental Electives (attached) by Spring quarter
of the Junior year. These petitions must be approved by the Undergraduate
Faculty Advisor and the Graduate Advisor of the Computer Science Department.</li>

<li>
Submit three letters of recommendation, preferably from Computer Science
Faculty.</li>

<li>
Submit a standard graduate application (which can be found in the Computer
Science department office). Do not submit this application to Graduate
Division. Return all sections of the application to the Computer Science
Graduate Program Assistant. You will <i>not</i> need to pay the $40.00
application fee.</li>

<li>
Include unofficial transcripts along with your BS/MS Petition</li>

<li>
If the student's GPA at the end of the junior year is at least 3.50 and
the letters of recommendation are strong, the student can be admitted to
the program without having to take the Graduate Record Exam (GRE).<i> (If
this proposal is acceptable only if this GRE waiver is omitted, it will
be.)</i> Graduate courses taken in the senior year will count for graduate
credit, provided they are not also used to satisfy the BS unit requirements.</li>

<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>We want to make it as simple as possible for the very best students
to stay at UCSB.&nbsp; We think offering particularly strong students the
option of skipping the GREs <i>strengthens</i> the program:
<ul>
<li>
Requiring the GRE of these students delays their admission to the program:&nbsp;
They typically will not complete their GREs until the middle of the Fall
quarter of their senior year, thus delaying their admission until the Winter
quarter.&nbsp; If a graduate course offered in the Fall quarter is of strong
interest to a student, not being allowed to take it will reduce the attractiveness
of the program markedly.</li>

<li>
We already know these students.&nbsp; They are high achieving students
as judged both by their GPA <i>and</i> their letters of recommendation.&nbsp;
We do not need to see their GREs:&nbsp; We know that they will succeed
in the masters program.</li>

<li>
If we force them to take the GREs, we needlessly increase the risk that
they will go elsewhere (either to another school who does not know them
and thus does require them to take the GREs, or directly to industry).</li>
</ul>
Requiring the very best students to take the GRE reduces the program's
attractiveness to these top students, <i>without improving</i> the program's
quality.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<li>
If the student's GPA at the end of the junior year is at least 3.00, but
less than 3.50, the student is required to take the Graduate Record Exam
(GRE). Admission to the Program is then granted or denied before the second
quarter of your senior year. Any graduate courses taken after admission
to the Program will count for graduate credit, provided that is not used
to satisfy the B.S. unit requirements.&nbsp; <i>When taking such a course,
students are subject to the same rules that apply to computer science graduate
students.</i></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p>The Computer Science Department's Graduate Program Assistant would:
<ul>
<li>
be the liaison with the Graduate Division for this program</li>

<li>
meet with students, advise them regarding the application of units toward
the bachelors vs. master's degree components</li>

<li>
request the Graduate Division to change the status of those students who
have completed the 180 unit degree requirement.</li>
</ul>

<p><br><i>NOTE: Any graduate courses taken prior to admission into the
program cannot count towards the MS requirements.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Once all requirements have been met for the Bachelor of Science degree,
students must immediately declare their candidacy for this degree with
the Registrar's Office. Graduate status is attained after completion of
the 180 units of undergraduate course work.</li>
</ol>
During the Winter and Spring quarters of their Senior year, they should
take four units of graduate computer science courses, increasing the total
units for these quarters from 12 to 16. By taking these units, in their
senior year, they can complete the M.S. requirements in the fifth year.

<hr WIDTH="100%"></ul>
We think that CCS students often will finish the combined program in
<i>less</i>
than five years; they often take 16 or more units per quarter.&nbsp; If,
in the unlikely event, a student does not complete the program in five
years, we will allow that student to continue for at most one more year.
<p>We expect this program to serve the brightest of the bright:&nbsp; High
achieving CCS students.&nbsp; To apply, students must have at least a 3.0
GPA, and have strong letters of recommendation, typically from Computer
Science faculty.&nbsp; If their GPA is less than 3.5, they must also take
the GRE.&nbsp; In all respects, our standards for admission will be no
less than that for regular masters students.
<p>There currently are about 20 students in CCS with an emphasis in computer
science.&nbsp; We expect, of these, that approximately three students per
year might apply to this program.&nbsp; This is <i>in addition to</i> the
the existing degree programs, including the Computer Science Department's
BS/MS program.
<h2>
Resource Requirements</h2>
We do not expect the program to increase the faculty workload noticeably.&nbsp;
No new courses will be needed.&nbsp; We do not expect any additional resource
requirements with respect to faculty FTE or library acquisitions.&nbsp;
The additional of three students will increase our need for space and computing
resources commensurately---approximately 3%. We think that this does <i>not</i>
constitute a resource requirement.&nbsp; These students may apply for Teaching
Assistantships.&nbsp; The Department welcomes the addition of a few more
high quality TA candidates into its TA applicant pool.
