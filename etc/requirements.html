<h1>Degree Requirements</h1>
<p>Students are expected to
maintain a 3.00 grade point average (GPA) in
their computer science courses, with a 2.75 GPA being the minimum GPA
acceptable in major courses.
</p>
<p>Students are subject to the
Unit, Subject A (English Composition), and American History and
Institutions requirements of the University of California, Santa
Barbara (UCSB), as
well as the General Education Requirements of the College of Creative
Studies (CCS).
</p>
<h2> Lower Division</h2>
<h3>Mathematics</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Math 3A-B-C -- 12 units<br>
  </li>
  <li> Math 5A-B -- 8 units</li>
</ul>
<h3>Science</h3>
Twenty units from the following list, including at least 1 laboratory
course:
<ul>
  <li>Physics: 1, 2, 3 &amp;
3L, 4 &amp; 4L, 5 &amp; 5L<br>
  </li>
  <li>Chemistry: 1A &amp; 1AL, 1B &amp; 1BL, 1C &amp; 1CL</li>
  <li> Molecular, Cellular,
&amp; Developmental Biology: 1A &amp; 1AL<br>
  </li>
  <li> Molecular, Cellular,
&amp; Developmental Biology: 1B &amp; EEMB 2 &amp; (1BL or 2L)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Computer Science</h3>
<ul>
  <li>CCS CS 1A &amp; L</li>
  <li>CCS CS 2</li>
</ul>
<p>They also are required to take
those CCS computer science courses, and
any other UCSB courses, that the student's faculty advisor deems
necessary. This aspect of the curriculum is tailored for each
student.</p>
<p>In the mathematics and science courses listed above, students may
instead take a CCS course that their advisor deems acceptable. Some of
the requirements above also can be met via <span
 style="font-style: italic;">advanced placement</span> (please see the
General Catalog).
</p>
<h2> Upper Division</h2>
<p>
The upper division requirements are the same as those for upper
division computer science majors in the College of
Engineering (Bachelor of Science degree program). These include the
Major requirements, the Major Electives, and the Ethics requirement.
However, CCS students are not required to
satisfy the formal prerequisites for the upper division courses that
they take. Rather, they meet with their CCS faculty
advisor each quarter, and obtain approval for their planned course of
study
for the next quarter.
</p>
<p>Under exceptional
circumstances, certain upper division CS course requirements may be
<span style="font-style: italic;">waived</span>.&nbsp; Examples of such
circumstances include a case in
which a student has completed advanced work or research in the topic of
the course(s), or has arranged to take a more advanced
course.&nbsp; All such waivers require written advisor approval. </p>
