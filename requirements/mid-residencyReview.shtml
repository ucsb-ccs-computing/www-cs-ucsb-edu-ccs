<h1>Requirements</h1>

<p>
Below, we state the course requirements for the College of Creative Studies Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
In addition to our B.S. program, we have a 
<a href="BSMS.shtml">5-year B.S.-M.S. Computer Science program</a>, 
where the B.S. is from the College of Creative Studies and the M.S. is from the College of Engineering.
</p>

<h2>Courses</h2>

<h3> Lower Division</h3>

<h4>Mathematics</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Math 3A-B-C -- 12 units</li>
  <li> Math 5A-B -- 8 units</li>
  <li>PSTAT 120A - 4 units</li>
</ul>

<h4>Science</h4>

<p>
Twenty units from the following list, including at least 1 laboratory course:

<ul>
  <li>Physics: 1, 2, 3 &amp; 3L, 4 &amp; 4L, 5 &amp; 5L</li>
  <li>Chemistry: 1A &amp; 1AL, 1B &amp; 1BL, 1C &amp; 1CL</li>
  <li> Molecular, Cellular, &amp; Developmental Biology: 1A &amp; 1AL</li>
  <li> Molecular, Cellular, &amp; Developmental Biology: 1B &amp; EEMB 2 &amp; (1BL or 2L)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Computer Science</h4>

<ul>
  <li>CCS CS 1A &amp; L</li>
  <li>CCS CS 2</li>
</ul>

<p>
They also are required to take those CCS computer science courses, and
any other UCSB courses, that the student's faculty advisor deems
necessary. This aspect of the curriculum is tailored for each
student.
</p>

<p>
In the mathematics and science courses listed above, students may
instead take a CCS course that their advisor deems acceptable. Some of
the requirements above also can be met via <i>advanced placement</i> (please see the General Catalog).
</p>

<h3> Upper Division</h3>

<p>
The upper division requirements equal those for the 
<a href="http://cs.ucsb.edu/undergraduate/requirements/">B.S. in computer science in the College of Engineering</a>. 
These include the Major requirements, the Major Field Electives, and the Ethics requirement.
However, CCS students are not required to satisfy the formal prerequisites for the upper division courses that
they take. Rather, they meet with their CCS faculty advisor each quarter, and obtain approval for their planned 
course of study for the next quarter.
</p>

<p>
Under exceptional circumstances, certain upper division CS course requirements may be
<i>waived</i>. Examples of such circumstances include a case in
which a student has completed advanced work or research in the topic of
the course(s), or has arranged to take a more advanced
course. All such waivers require written advisor approval.
</p>

<h3>General Requirements <a href="Jan08CcsGraduationGeRequirements.doc">(Word)</a></h3>

<h2>Mid-Residency Review</h2>

<p>
The CCS/CS Program views the mid residency review as a mid-course adjustment, which provides the student with 
a bigger picture than quarterly individual advising provides. 
It is meant to give them a chance to report on their progress, reflect on what they have set out to do, 
what they have accomplished so far and where they want to go, and to make sure that their progress is aligned 
with the goals of the CCS Computer Science Program.
</p>

<p>
The procedure for the mid-residency review for CCS/CS students was determined in 2006 by a joint meeting of the 
faculty and CCS students. As a mid-residency review, an oral presentation by the student in which a majority of
CCS CS faculty is present is conducted. The student's peers are invited to take part in the presentation,
which should be about 20 minutes. CCS/CS students are expected to proceed with this review at the end of the fifth
quarter of their studies in the CCS Computer Science program. The review takes place sometime towards the end 
of the finals week of the winter quarter of each year.
</p>

<p>
After the public part of the presentation, the faculty meet briefly to discuss the student's progress and to 
make recommendations. The faculty may choose to have an informal private meeting with the student. Based on the 
meeting and the ensuing discussion, the student is notified if there are concerns about progress and the 
appropriateness of the CCS Program for the student. If this is the case, specific advising guidelines and 
academic goals will be agreed upon in consultation with the student. Formal feedback to the student is 
provided and a written memorandum is placed in the student's file with a copy to the student.
</p>

<p>
CCS students felt that informal feedback from peers and during the public part of the review would be invaluable. 
No written comments from the student's peers will be solicited, as some issues were voiced as to the 
appropriateness of this.
