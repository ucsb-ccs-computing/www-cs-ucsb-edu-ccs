<h1>College of Engineering CS Regents Scholar Track</h1>

<h2>The Opportunity</h2>

<p>
As a UCSB computer science Regents Scholar, you have the
opportunity to
participate in a special course sequence that enables you to take upper
division computer science courses after your first year in the program,
which is one full year sooner than customary. As a consequence, you can
take graduate computer science courses your entire senior year, and you
may be able to collaborate on research with Computer Science faculty as
early as your sophomore year. Since UCSB is a research university, this
is an advantage over programs offered by non-research universities or
colleges, and by research universities that have no such accelerated
program. This uniquely enriching experience will serve you, regardless
of whether you pursue a career in industry, entrepreneurial activity,
or an advanced degree.
</p>

<h2>The Accelerated Course Sequence</h2>

<p>
Regents Scholars may elect to take the accelerated
course sequence that is listed below.

<p>
Participants who have no prior computer programming experience may
have additional courses prescribed. Each participant's progress is monitored quarterly by the Computer Science
Department Undergraduate Advisor and the College of Engineering
Associate Dean for Student Affairs, in consultation with the student's
instructors. Upon satisfactory completion of these courses for a
minimum of 24 units, a participant petitions to have these courses
substitute for CMPSC 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60, and the ability to
take upper division courses in the Computer Science
department. If a participant receives too few units in some of these courses, indicating
an unsatisfactory performance, he/she
will be prescribed additional lower division courses, which under some
circumstances will delay his/her ability to take upper divsion courses in the Computer Science Department.
</p>

      <ul>

        <li>CCS courses are P/NP, not graded.</li>

        <li>COE CMPSC 60 is graded.</li>
