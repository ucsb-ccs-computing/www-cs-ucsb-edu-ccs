<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>
The Computer Science Program shares the College of Creative Studies 
<a href="http://www.ccs.ucsb.edu/welcome/">Vision</a> and 
<a href="http://www.ccs.ucsb.edu/mission_statement/">Mission</a>.
It bridges the gap between traditional computer 
science curricula and the lively, rapidly changing universe of computing at large. It is personalized to 
challenge each student and develop to the utmost his or her knowledge and creativity. The program is aimed at 
highly ambitious students with a demonstrated talent in computer science who are interested in exploring and 
contributing to the field. Many students in the CCS computer science program are also interested in other 
scientific fields, and concurrently pursue studies in another program, such as physics and/or mathematics. 
Collaboration with the Computer Science Department in the College of Engineering offers a stimulating and 
supportive environment and provides access to a number of laboratories and powerful computing platforms.
</p>

<p>
CCS computer science students start their studies by following an accelerated curriculum covering the mathematical 
foundations of computer science and programming techniques. This background paves the way to upper-division 
courses covering preparatory material for diverse specializations such as networks, distributed computing, 
computational theory, algorithm design, computer graphics, compilers, and database theory. Advanced courses 
provide both the depth and the breadth necessary for graduate-level research at top-ranked institutions in the 
United States and abroad.
</p>

<p>
Early in their studies, CCS computer science students can participate in innovative and challenging research 
projects that are typically reserved for graduate students. These range from purely theoretical studies to 
programming parallel computers for important applications in other fields of science.
</p>

<h2>Computer Science Program Mission</h2>

<p>
Recruit the most talented and imaginative undergraduates, and provide them with the intellectual environment and 
advice that enables them to transition quickly from consumers of computer science knowledge to producers of such 
knowledge, that is, creative computer science colleagues.
</p>
	
<h2>Computer Science Program Goals</h2>

<ul>

    <li>Vigorously identify and recruit students possessing productive and original minds from California and beyond;</li>

    <li>Enter each student in an intensive program of course work tailored to his or her strengths, goals, and creative interest;</li>

    <li>Provide these students with consistent, individual assistance from committed staff and faculty as they develop their own sense of purpose and direction;</li>

    <li>Offer small classes on subjects where students interact and develop a sense of the creative endeavor;</li>

    <li>Facilitate original work by students, starting in their freshman year, under the direction of CCS faculty, COE Computer Science faculty, and faculty from departments in the Colleges of Letters &amp; Science and Engineering;</li>

    <li>Assure that each graduate completes a body of original work, in the form of a report of completed scientific research.</li>
